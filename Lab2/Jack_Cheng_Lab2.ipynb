    "(a) [2 points] Write a discrete convolution function myConv that convolves two arrays f and w to obtain an output time series g. For simplicity, assume a fixed sampling interval δ = 1, and further, that f and w are 0 outside of their sampled regions. How long is g ? In other words, how many non-zero points can it have? Justify your answer.\n",
